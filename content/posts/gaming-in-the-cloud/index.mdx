## My personal use case

Ok, the thing is I'm not a hardcore gamer or anything like that. In fact I don't play much games at all. There are some phases though in which I want to enjoy a particular game, for instance I really enjoy open world games such as GTA and Red Dead Redemption. I also with the recent release of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 discovered a genre that appeals to me. Probably because of it's technicalities and realism which I'm drawn to.

My primary computer is a Macbook Pro 16" from 2020. However given I run macOS, this limits options for gaming out of the gate. Also since I'm not a regular gamer I cannot justify buying an expensive rig for the wee hours that I play games. So I started looking for other options, and one of the most appealing options seemed to be gaming in the cloud. This would mean that I could play games on my Macbook while the heavy lifting (rendering) would be done in the cloud.

## Essentials

Given that idea, I came up with some essentials that I would like to see in a cloud gaming provider.

- Latency: obviously very important for playing games is the latency. In my case I don't expect any problems here since I have everything wired and have a gigabit fiber connection at home.
- Games availability: I only like particular games and there's no need for me to have every possible game available.
- Cloud provider availability: Given cloud gaming is still in it's infancy a lot of announced services are still not available mainstream. I would like to play today, so I'm looking for something that's available now.
- Ultra High Settings: Since I don't game often, _when_ I want to play, I do want to enjoy the highest possible settings. The promise of the cloud should make this possible.

### Cloud Gaming Services

- Google Stadia
- Geforce NOW
- Shadow PC
- Maximum Settings

#### Google Stadia

I've used Stadia for quite some time to play Red Dead Redemption 2 (I didn't play this game before on other platforms). I have to say I really liked the ease of use of this service. Basically you open a browser, and you're good to go. No software to install, not even a browser extension.

#### Shadow PC

It took a long while to even get access to a Shadow PC instance. They have long waiting lists which also indicated there's high demand.

### Roll-your-own solutions

- Paperspace
- Microsoft Azure
- Amazon AWS
- Google Cloud

## Pros and Cons of Gaming in the Cloud

Most online gaming services are just not ready at this moment. It seems there is plenty interest from the community, however these startups just can't scale quickly enough to onboard everyone at once. Which either means long pre-order times, or being just lucky in securing a spot when instances do become available.

## Conclusion

Google Stadia is so far my favorite option for gaming. The only downside I think at this point is that there's not yet that many games available in the store, although they are increasing quickly. Some titles will probably never see the light of day via the Google Stadia store, for example due to publisher restrictions or licensing. Until that time I'll go with a custom VM until other options become more readily available.
